# How to contribute to the Deputy API Wrapper

Thank you for considering contributing to the Deputy API Wrapper.

Community Data Solutions (CDS) is looking for contributors to help adding new features, functionality and responding to changes made to the API by Deputy.

The aim of the wrapper is to simplify or abstract the API to allow developers to perform more complex interactions without needing to know how it is achieved.

## Found a bug?

If you have found a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
Email opensource@communityds.com.au instead.

When filing a bug report:

* What version of this package were you using?
* What type and version of the adapter were you using?
* What version of PHP were you using?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?

Submit the report as an Issue on GitHub.

## Request a feature or enhancement

There is an active [To-Do list](docs/todo.md).

Contact CDS via opensource@communityds.com.au if you would like to know when a certain item is on our road map.
We may ask you to implement the feature.   

When submitting a feature request:

* Explain what the feature should achieve, ideally via use cases or referencing other material.
* Explain potential impacts on existing functionality.

Submit the request as an Issue.

## How to submit a contribution

1. Fork our GitHub repository.
2. Create a dedicated branch in your forked repository off of the `develop` branch.
3. Make changes within your branch.
4. Finalise your changes to ensure:
    * All unit tests pass.
    * Changes have been covered via a unit test.
    * Changes comply with the PSR2 Coding Standard.
    * Documentation has been written or updated explaining the change.
    * Each commit should reflect a working version (i.e. no work-in-progress commits).
5. Submit a Pull Request to the `develop` branch.

## Review process

CDS will review Issues and Pull Requests monthly.

The repository uses a [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) model to manage the release process.

Approved Pull Requests will have their commits merged in to the `develop` branch.
Once the `develop` branch is considered stable, CDS will manage the release process.
CDS will update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with each official release and attribute the author.

our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at opensource@communityds.com.au. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
